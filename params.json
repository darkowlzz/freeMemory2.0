{"name":"Free Memory 2.0","tagline":"Freeup clogged memory from Firefox.","body":"### What is Free Memory?\r\nFree Memory is a restartless Firefox add-on that has saved the lives of thousands of Firefox users from the widespread memory consumption issue. On some computers, usually with less system memory, when a lot of tabs are open, a huge amount of memory gets clogged and affect the system performance, degrading Firefox experience. Free Memory has helped a lot of Firefox users to come out of the memory issues and continue using their favorite web browser.\r\n\r\n### What does it do?\r\nIt provides access to the hidden switches in Firefox that help freeup the clogged memory in Firefox. The 3 switches it offer are the 3 memory operations, Garbage Collection, Cycle Collection and Memory Minimization. Memory Minimization combines the former operations, along with some magic ingredients built inside the browser, and attempts to freeup the memory. These operations are hidden under a special page within Firefox called the about:memory page. These operations can be triggered by the user or, even better, automated.\r\n\r\n### How do I use it?\r\nOnce the add-on is install from [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/free-memory-20/), a small icon would appear in the toolbar. Clicking on the icon opens up a panel with the memory operation options. Clicking any of them starts the respective memory operation.\r\n![Memory Operations](https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/168/168327.png)\r\n\r\nAnother way to access the panel is using the shortcut keys. By default the key combo are Alt + Shift + M. This can be changed from the add-on preferences.\r\n\r\nTo automate the memory cleanup, open Firefox Add-ons Manager with Cmd + Shift + A (OS X) or Ctrl + Shift + A (Windows & Linux) or from the Tools Menu > Add-ons. In the extensions tab of the Add-ons Manager, double click Free Memory and open the add-on preferences page.\r\n![Add-on Preferences](https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/168/168328.png)\r\n\r\nThis page provides a lot of customization features of the add-on. At the bottom of the preferences is the Timer option. It is 0 minutes by default. Increment it and set the time in minutes at which it should perform Memory Minimization.\r\n\r\n### Some Happy Free Memory Users\r\n> Works without problems!
